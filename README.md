# mhw
The mhw is an matlab - based toolbox for detection and analysis of marine heatwaves (MHWs).
# Functions
detect_mhw, aim to detect spatio-temporal distribution MHW events following definition of Hobday et al. (2016).

maxtp, aim to obtain the maximum value of the vertical temperature anomaly and the depth at which it is located.

mintp, aim to obtain the minimum value of the vertical temperature anomaly and the depth at which it is located.

bootstrp_percentage, aim to obtain the statistics (mean and standard deviation) on the percentage of different categories in the sample.

dailyclimanom, aim to obtain the daily anomaly and climatology of the three dimensional data (lon,lat,t).

t_tendency, aim to obtain the mixed layer temperature tendency (3D matrix) term of heat budget.

t_surfaceforcing, aim to obtain the surface heat flux forcing (3D matrix) term of heat budget.

t_advection, aim to obtain the horizontal advection (3D matrix) term of heat budget.

corr_sig, aim to obtain correlation coefficient of two data sets and T-test result.
